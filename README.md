# Robin Manchanda - Data Science Projects Portfolio

Hello!

My name is Robin Manchanda. I have two years of professional experience working as a junior technical officer at ECIL, India, where I worked mainly with the maintenance of sensors in electronic voting machines(EVMs). As I had a keen interest in the data, I voluntarily started working with the data analytics team. We analyzed Sensor Data by using tools such as python, pandas, and tableau. While working at ECIL, I found out how predictive maintenance using AI can be used to reduce failure rates. This is how I found my passion for data science. To learn more about this field, I started my post-graduate studies enrolling in the [Artificial Intelligence Analysis, Design and Implementation](https://durhamcollege.ca/programs/artificial-intelligence-analysis-design-and-implementation-graduate-certificate), where I learned the theory/concepts of AI. To further enhance my knowledge, I am currently studying [Applied A.I. Solutions Development](https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/applied-ai-solutions-development-program-postgraduate-t431) at George Brown. I am now a step closer to achieving my dream of becoming a Full Stack Data Scientist.
